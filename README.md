# In this project, the following tasks have been successfully solved: 
# 1. Write the following formulas in the Java programming language.
# 2. Write a program that calculates the volume and surface area of a sphere for a given radius. The volume of a sphere is V = 4/3Pir^3, and the surface area is A = 4Pir^2.
# 3. Write a program that calculates the surface area of a triangle for given side lengths a, b, and c. s = (a+b+c) / 2, A = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)).
# 4. Write a program that outputs the grade for a test score. A student can score from 0 to 100 points. Grading is as follows: 0-50 5, 51-60 6, 61-70 7, 71-80 8, 81-90 9, 91-100 10.
# 5. Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated using the following formula: BMI = m / h^2, where m is the mass in kilograms and h is the height in meters. The recommended classification of BMI is as follows: < 18.5 Underweight, 18.5-25 Normal weight, 25-30 Overweight, > 30 Obesity.
# 6. Write a program that, given the day of the week's ordinal number, outputs the name of that day.
# 7. Write a program that prints numbers from the following intervals (try various loops): [0, 10], [1, 15] with a step of 2, [21, 3], [17, -10] with a step of -3.
# 8. Write a program that calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers for a given n.
# 9. Write a program that, given an array of numbers: outputs the smallest element in the array, outputs the largest element in the array, outputs the sum of the values in the array, outputs the average value for the array.
